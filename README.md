## ⭐ About Me

🎓 I am Firdaus Al Ghifari, a software engineer with experiences in front-end (React, Flutter), back-end (Golang, Python, Java), and machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch). Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Pintarnya, where I developed its job-seeking platform on both the front-end and the back-end side.

👨‍💻 Previously, I worked at TamanSchool.com startup as a Software Engineer. I managed a 4-people engineering team and architected the company's first product, an online tutoring platform using React, Django, Docker, and AWS.

🏠 Outside of work, I am also passionate about building a business or startup. One particular project, Purwalenta.com, had around 4000 monthly active users. I managed the engineering team to build a web and Android app using Kotlin, React, Django, and AWS.

🎸 I loved to play sports, especially Badminton, Tennis, and Basketball. I also like meeting new people over a cup of coffee. Feel free to [connect and reach out to me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alghi/).

🏅 Achievements: TensorFlow Certified Developer, Most Outstanding Student on Entrepreneurship Faculty of Computer Science Universitas Indonesia '22, ACM ICPC Asia Jakarta National Bronze Medalist '19.
